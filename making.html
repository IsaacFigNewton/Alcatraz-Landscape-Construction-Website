		<p>My job was to research code for the UI of the engine and code for the engine. For this, I followed the following steps:</p>
		<ol> 
		<li>First, I figured out the code to draw a canvas lines.</li>
		<li>Then, I wrote the iteration statement to draw the line with the end point's cordinates that is generated by a list that was created by Ben. </li>
		<li>Next, I got the program to draw a line that started at the cordinates where the mouse clik and ended when the mouse is released.</li>
		<li>Lastly, I tried to set up a function that draw the next line where the last line was left off.</li>
		<li>The last two functions were intended for our game where we challenge the user to recreate the fractal, but we ran out of time.</li>
		</ol>

		<p>My job was to create the fractal-generation engine and for this, I followed the following steps:</p>
		<ol>
		<li>I started by making a custom linked list of 'line' objects as a class</li>
		<li>Next, I defined a function that replaced lines with instances of the base object.</li>
		<li>Then I had to create a function capable of combining the base, interative, and final point lists into a full fractal!</li>
		<li>Then came bugfixing. This was especially hard, since visual studio was unable to run the debugger on my script.</li>
		<li>With the engine done, I combined the various UI functions Hahn designed into a usable editor.</li>
		<li>That's the short version.

		<p>My job was to research fractals and compose information for the about page. For this, I followed the following steps:</p>
		<ol>
		<li>Write the "What are Fractals?" infromation and come up with a definition for a fractal.</li>
		<li>First learn and then effetively explain what the Mandelbröt set is (which was the hardest thing I did) and then write about other artificial fractals.</li>
		<li>Then I searched and pointed out some common fractals found in nature.</li>
		<li>After that I talked found and added some fun facts about fractals.</li>
		<li>Then I made a GitHub account for our team.</li>
		<li>Lastly, my team recommended that we add the fun fact that a pinapples is a fractal.</li>
		</ol>

		<p>My job was to set up the VPS and the website's framework, as well as the titles and names. For this, I followed the following steps:</p>
		<ol>
		<li>First I consulted with my group on what they’d like the website to look like.</li>
		<li>Then, I created a basic website page design for each page.</li>
		<li>Next, I added background images and formatting.</li>
		<li>Next, I helped Victoria finish one of her information bits and understand another.</li>
		<li>I noticed some problems with the header background image, so I spent 30 minutes adjusting it to get it perfect.</li>
		<li>Then I spent the next hour or so fine-tuning the website, adding pictures, and the likes.</li>
		<li>Then, once Victoria finished her bit, I added her text in.</li>
		<li>Penultimately, I helped Ben and put all the code together.</li>
		<li>Finally I added Benjamin’s code and uploaded the files to GitHub.</li>
		</ol>
